Welcome to fck's documentation!
===============================

Here be is the documentation for fck. If you've somehow ended up here with no idea how (well done on that), the `website <https://rosiepuddles.github.io/fck/>`_ might be more useful. Just a thought.

If any of the documentation seems wrong or could be phrased better etc., please open a `bug report <https://github.com/RosiePuddles/fck/issues/new?assignees=&labels=documentation&template=documentation-request.md&title=>`_.
